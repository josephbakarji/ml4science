# Understanding Data Through PDEs: From Modeling to Discovery

## 1. Introduction

Suppose you have measurements of a quantity $$u(x,t)$$ in space $$x$$ and time
$$t$$. The problem you want to solve is:

> **How can we use these measurements to understand the system and predict its future evolution?**

One of the most powerful frameworks for tackling this problem is **partial
differential equations (PDEs)**. PDEs allow us to capture how $$u(x,t)$$ changes
in both space and time using derivatives. By combining information about how
$$u$$ changes in space and time, we often uncover fundamental
relationships—ranging from conservation principles to physical laws—that govern
the evolution of $$u$$.

In many physical systems (e.g., fluid flow, heat conduction, wave propagation),
the assumptions of continuity and differentiability are reasonable, so classical
PDEs serve as an excellent modeling tool. Once a PDE is identified or assumed,
we can solve it—either analytically or numerically—to predict or interpret the
system’s behavior.


## 2. The Role of Differential Equations

### 2.1 Why Use Differential Equations?

Differential equations link **changes** of a function $$u$$ to the function
itself and possibly its spatial variations. This linkage arises from the idea
that **local changes** in space and/or time are driven by **local properties**
of $$u$$. For example:

- **Advection**: where a quantity is transported or carried along by a flow with velocity $$c$$.
- **Diffusion**: where a quantity tends to spread out due to concentration gradients.
- **Waves**: where oscillatory or periodic disturbances propagate through the medium.

### 2.2 Simple Example: The Advection Equation

Consider the assumption that **the change in $$u$$ with respect to time is
proportional to the change in $$u$$ with respect to space**. Symbolically, in
discrete form, you might say:

$$
\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta t} \propto \frac{\Delta u}{\Delta x}.
$$

Taking the limit $$\Delta x \to 0$$ and $$\Delta t \to 0$$, we obtain

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \;=\; 0,
$$

where $$c$$ is the proportionality constant (interpreted as a constant
velocity). This is the **advection equation**, which essentially describes how
the quantity $$u$$ is translated with speed $$c$$. 

#### Derivation from a Lagrangian Perspective

An alternative derivation: If $$u(x,t)$$ is advected with speed $$c$$, then in
a moving coordinate system $$\xi = x - ct$$, $$u$$ does not change with time.
Thus,

$$
\frac{d}{dt} u(x-ct,t) \;=\; 0 \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \left(\frac{d\xi}{dt}\right)\frac{\partial
u}{\partial x} \;=\; 0,
$$

and because $$d\xi/dt = -c$$, we get 

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \;=\; 0.
$$


### 2.3 The Diffusion Equation

The **diffusion equation** states that the rate of change in time of $$u$$ is
proportional to the spatial curvature (second derivative) of $$u$$. In discrete
terms, you might approximate the “change of the change” in $$u$$ over space and
equate it to the change in time:

$$
\frac{\Delta \left(\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta x}\right)}{\Delta x} \;\approx\;
\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta t}.
$$

As $$\Delta x \to 0$$ and $$\Delta t \to 0$$, this leads to the continuous form:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \;=\; D\, \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
$$

where $$D$$ is the **diffusion coefficient**. 

#### Physical Interpretation

- A positive second derivative ($$\partial^2 u/\partial x^2$$) indicates a local minimum in $$u$$ which causes $$u$$ to increase over time.
- A negative second derivative corresponds to a local maximum, causing $$u$$ to decrease over time.

This process **smooths out** the quantity $$u$$ over time.


### 2.4 Advection–Diffusion Equation

If a quantity is **both** carried along by advection **and** has a diffusive
tendency, we combine the two effects:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \;+\; c\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \;=\;
D\,\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.
$$

Examples:

- **Heat** in a moving fluid: advected by fluid flow with velocity $$c$$ and diffused by thermal conduction.
- **Pollutant** in a river: carried by the current and dispersed by molecular and turbulent diffusion.


### 2.5 The Wave Equation

The **wave equation** models oscillatory systems, such as vibrations of a
guitar string, pressure waves in air, or electromagnetic waves in vacuum. Its 1D
form is:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} \;=\; v^2\,\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
$$

where $$v$$ is the wave speed. 

- **Physical derivation** often comes from force balance (like tension in a string) leading to a spatial derivative of tension forces and Newton’s second law for acceleration ($$\partial^2 u/\partial t^2$$).


## 3. Conservation Laws and PDE Derivations

An even more systematic approach to deriving PDEs is through **conservation
laws**. The general statement is:

$$
\text{Flux in} \;-\; \text{Flux out} \;=\; \text{Accumulation}.
$$

### 3.1 Example in 1D

Let $$\rho(x,t)$$ be the density of some conserved quantity (mass, momentum,
number of cars, etc.). In an infinitesimal control volume $$[x, x+\Delta x]$$:

- **Flux in** at $$x$$ is $$F(x,t)$$.
- **Flux out** at $$x+\Delta x$$ is $$F(x+\Delta x,t)$$.
- **Accumulation** over $$[x, x+\Delta x]$$ in time $$\Delta t$$ is the change in total amount: 

  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{x}^{x+\Delta x} \rho(x', t)\, dx'.
  $$

Hence, we write:

$$
F(x,t) - F(x+\Delta x,t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{x}^{x+\Delta x}
\rho(x', t)\, dx'.
$$

Divide by $$\Delta x$$ and take the limit $$\Delta x \to 0$$. The fundamental
theorem of calculus yields:

$$
-\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}.
$$

Or equivalently,

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 0.
$$

### 3.2 Special Cases

1. **Mass conservation**: $$F = \rho v$$, giving

   $$
   \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\rho\,v) = 0.
   $$

2. **Momentum conservation**: $$F = \rho\,v^2 + \text{(pressure terms)}$$, etc.

3. **Traffic flow**: $$\rho$$ is car density, and $$v(\rho)$$ might be a known
velocity-density relationship. Then $$F = \rho\,v(\rho)$$.

Such conservation arguments are the starting point for many PDEs found in fluid
mechanics (the Navier–Stokes equations), gas dynamics (Euler equations), and
beyond.


## 4. Analytical Solutions

Many PDEs—especially linear ones—admit **closed-form analytical solutions**
under certain conditions (e.g., specific domain geometries, boundary/initial
conditions).

### 4.1 Separation of Variables

A classic technique, **separation of variables**, is applicable when the PDE
and boundary conditions have certain forms of linearity and homogeneity. We
assume:

$$
u(x,t) = X(x)\,T(t).
$$

#### Example: 1D Diffusion Equation

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D\,\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.
$$

Plugging $$u(x,t) = X(x)\,T(t)$$ in:

$$
X(x)\,\frac{d T(t)}{d t} = D\,T(t)\,\frac{d^2 X(x)}{d x^2}.
$$

Divide both sides by $$D\,X(x)\,T(t)$$:

$$
\frac{1}{D}\,\frac{1}{T(t)}\;\frac{d T}{dt} = \frac{1}{X(x)}\;\frac{d^2
X}{dx^2}.
$$

The left-hand side depends only on $$t$$, and the right-hand side depends only
on $$x$$. For them to be equal for all $$x$$ and $$t$$, they must each be equal
to a **constant**, say $$-\lambda$$. Then:

$$
\frac{1}{T} \,\frac{d T}{dt} = -\lambda D, 
\quad\quad
\frac{1}{X} \,\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = -\lambda.
$$

We get two ODEs:

$$
\frac{d T}{d t} = -\lambda D\, T,
\quad\quad
\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = -\lambda\,X.
$$

Solving these gives families of solutions, which we combine and then use
boundary and initial conditions to fix constants.

### 4.2 Boundary and Initial Conditions

- **Initial condition**: $$u(x,0) = f(x)$$.
- **Boundary conditions**: e.g., 
  - Dirichlet: $$u(0,t) = \alpha_0,\, u(L,t) = \alpha_L$$.
  - Neumann: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(0,t) = 0,\dots$$.

Conditions define how the solution behaves at the edges and at $$t=0$$. Without
them, the solution to a PDE is not unique (or may not exist in a classical
sense).

## 5. Numerical Solutions

Many real-world PDEs (especially **nonlinear** ones) do not succumb to neat
analytical solutions. In these cases, we turn to **numerical methods**.

### 5.1 Spatial and Temporal Discretization

Let $$x_i = x_0 + i\,\Delta x$$ ($$i = 0,\dots,N$$), and $$t_j = t_0 +
j\,\Delta t$$ ($$j = 0,\dots,M$$). We define:

$$
u_i^j \;\equiv\; u(x_i, t_j).
$$

Then we approximate derivatives. For instance:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\Big|_{(x_i,\,t_j)} 
\approx \frac{u_i^{j+1} - u_i^j}{\Delta t},
$$

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\Big|_{(x_i,\,t_j)} 
\approx \frac{u_{i+1}^j - 2\,u_i^j + u_{i-1}^j}{(\Delta x)^2}.
$$

### 5.2 Example: Explicit Finite Difference Scheme for Diffusion

For the diffusion equation:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} 
= D\,\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
$$

approximate each side:

$$
\frac{u_i^{j+1} - u_i^j}{\Delta t} 
= D\,\frac{u_{i+1}^j - 2u_i^j + u_{i-1}^j}{(\Delta x)^2}.
$$

Rearrange to find $$u_i^{j+1}$$:

$$
u_i^{j+1} 
= u_i^j 
+ D\,\frac{\Delta t}{(\Delta x)^2} 
\bigl(u_{i+1}^j - 2u_i^j + u_{i-1}^j\bigr).
$$

**Python-like Pseudo-Code**:

```python
for j in range(time_steps):
    for i in range(1, N-1):  # skip boundary points if Dirichlet or handle them otherwise
        u_new[i] = (u[i] 
                     + D*(dt/dx**2) * (u[i+1] - 2*u[i] + u[i-1]))
    u[:] = u_new[:]
```

#### Stability Criterion

For the explicit diffusion scheme, a common criterion is:

$$
r = \frac{D\,\Delta t}{(\Delta x)^2} \;\leq\; \frac{1}{2} 
\quad\longrightarrow\quad
\Delta t \;\le\; \frac{(\Delta x)^2}{2\,D}.
$$

If $$r$$ is too large, the numerical solution can become unstable.

## 6. Conclusion

In this chapter, we explored how PDEs provide a framework for **understanding
data** that varies in space and time. Key insights:

1. **Modeling from Principles**: Basic physical/engineering assumptions (like
advection or diffusion) or fundamental conservation laws (mass, momentum,
energy) lead to **canonical PDEs** (advection, diffusion, wave equations, etc.).
 
2. **Analytical Solutions**: For simple PDEs with standard boundary/initial
conditions, we can solve analytically (e.g., via **separation of variables**).  
3. **Numerical Methods**: More complex or nonlinear PDEs typically require
discretization (finite differences, finite elements, etc.) to simulate the
system’s evolution in time.  
4. **Data-Driven Discovery (SINDy)**: With modern computational power and
measurement techniques, we can estimate derivatives directly from data and then
**infer the PDE** itself via sparse regression.

This approach—merging theoretical derivations, numerical solutions, and
data-driven methods—enables engineers and scientists to **gain insight** into
complex spatiotemporal phenomena, predict future states, and even **uncover new
physical laws** where the governing PDEs were previously unknown.
