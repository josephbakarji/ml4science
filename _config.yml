course_name: Data-Driven Modeling in Science and Engineering
course_description: "
How do we go from a high dimensional, noisy, nonlinear, complex, and multiscale universe to 
simple and predictive mathematical models? This course introduces modern machine learning techniques 
using a wide variety of examples in physical, social and biological sciences. 
Modern data-driven approaches that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning are introduced, 
including: sparse identification of differential equations, dynamics mode decomposition, 
and physics informed neural networks."
