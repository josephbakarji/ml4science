## **Overview**

The final project is your opportunity to synthesize everything youâ€™ve learned in the course into a meaningful and original application. Your goal is to tackle a real-world or scientific problem, combining domain knowledge with computational modeling and machine learning in a rigorous, creative, and insightful way.

This project is not just about performance metrics; it's about:
- Framing a well-posed scientific question  
- Designing and analyzing machine learning models in context  
- Iterating thoughtfully by analyzing results, going back to the data, and refining your model
- Demonstrating a deep understanding of your problem with a clear plan for future work

### **Final Presentation**  
The final presentation of your work will be on Wednesday, April 30 at 10:00am. The format is 5-minute presentation + 5-minute Q&A; you will get points for asking questions as well. The presentation should be roughly structured as:
- Motivation, question, and background
- Methodology and approach
- Key results and analysis
- Reflections and future directions
Plan your time accordingly. 5 minutes is not a lot of time, so make sure to practice your presentation.

### **Final Report**
- **Due:** Sunday, May 4 (at 23:59)
- **Length:** 6 pages (max), in a conference-style format (e.g., IEEE, NeurIPS, ICML)  
- **Contents:** (order and structure is flexible. Choose what is most appropriate for your project.)
  - Abstract  
  - Introduction and Motivation  
  - Related Work (with citations)  
  - Problem Formulation  
  - Methodology  
  - Results & Analysis  
  - Conclusion & Future Work  
  - References  
  - Link to **GitHub Repository**

The GitHub repo must contain: all relevant code, scripts, and notebooks. It should also have a README file with: setup instructions, description of the project structure, and clear instructions for reproducing results. Find tutorials online for how to set up a GitHub repo if you need to.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

Your final project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

| **Criteria** | **Description** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Creativity, Novelty, and Relevance** | Is the project original, insightful, or tackling a meaningful problem? |
| **Report Quality** | Is the report well-written, clearly structured, and within the 6-page limit? |
| **Literature Awareness** | Have you reviewed and referenced relevant prior work appropriately? |
| **Technical Rigor** | Is there a solid mathematical formulation, and is it suited to the dataset/context? Express yourself mathematically whenever possible. |
| **Use of Domain Knowledge** | Have you incorporated prior knowledge into the model design and hypothesis space? |
| **Scientific Thinking** | Did you iterate, test hypotheses, and refine your model based on results? |
| **Model Justification** | Are the chosen methods justified in relation to the problem and data? |
| **Results & Analysis** | Are the results critically analyzed and compared across models or approaches? |
| **Future Directions** | Are thoughtful improvements or extensions proposed? |
| **Code Quality & Reproducibility** | Is the code clean, documented, reproducible, and accessible via GitHub? |
| **Delivery & Follow-through** | Did you fulfill the goals promised in your original proposal? |
| **Timeliness** | Late submissions will be penalized |

## Final Remarks

- Start **early** and **ask questions** early.
- Your **depth of understanding** matters more than flashy results.  
- Ask questions. Meet with me or share roadblocks early if you get stuck.  

Let this project be a chance for you to **explore**, **create**, and **think like a scientist**.
