## Description
How do we go from a high dimensional, noisy, nonlinear, complex, and multiscale universe to simple and predictive mathematical models? This course introduces modern machine learning techniques using a wide variety of examples in physical, social and biological sciences. Modern data-driven approaches that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning are introduced, including: sparse identification of differential equations, dynamics mode decomposition, and physics informed neural networks.

**Prerequisites:** Programming Basics (EECE 230/231), Calculus and differential equations (MATH 202), Probability and Statistics (STAT 230 or MATH 218/219), Linear Algebra (MATH218), or equivalent experience.

## Topics 
### Overview 
- Machine learning is transforming science and engineering.
- The three pillars of artificial intelligence: modeling, learning and inference.
- Scientific Python: Scipy, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, etc.
- What is scientific modeling: laws, differential equations, linear systems, networks etc.
- Noise, probability, uncertainty quantificaiton, nonlinearity and chaos.
- The problem of scales and high-dimensionality.

### Introduction to Machine Learning
- Introduction to linear regression.
- Machine leraning theory: the variance-bias trade-off, hyperparameters, feature engineering, optimization, regularization.
- Types of ML models: parametric, non-parametric, supervised, unsupervised, etc.
- Application to empirical laws: Galileo’s pendulum.

### Time-Series Analysis
- Types of time-series: one dimensional, multi-dimensional, discrete, continuous, etc.
- Statistical methods and signal processing techniques.
- Spectral methods: Fourier transform

## Course Learning Outcomes
This course will provide a brief overview of machine learning methods, with a focus on applications in engineering and science. The purpose of this course is such that students are able to
- Collect, visualize, and clean data.
- Master the basics of machine learning theory and implement them in Python.
- Apply machine learning concepts to problems in science and engineering.
- Propose a data-driven hypothesis given a scientific modeling question.
- Identify when a data-driven approach is needed and which learning algorithms are appropriate for a given dataset.

**Academic Integrity & Student Conduct:** you will be held to an ethical standard higher than the one prevailing in the rest of the country. The measure (or the yard stick) is AUB’s Student Code of Conduct. The AUB catalog defines various forms of academic integrity (AI) violations of the trust between students and their teachers. Students should familiarize themselves with such violations (including plagiarism and cheating) as well as the penalties associated with such AI violations. 

**FERPA:** The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 affords students certain rights. These rights include that to provide consent before the University discloses personally identifiable information from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. Except for disclosures to school officials, disclosures related to some judicial orders or lawfully issued subpoenas, disclosures of directory information, and disclosures to the student, the institution is required to record the disclosure. Eligible students have a right to inspect and review the record of disclosures.
